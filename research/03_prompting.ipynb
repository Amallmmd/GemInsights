It is difficult to see a clear pattern in this graph, although it does appear that there may be a positive correlation between the two variables. The second graph shows box plots of the churn rate vs monthly charges. This graph shows that the churn rate is higher for customers with higher monthly charges. The third graph shows a bar chart of the average monthly charges for customers who churned vs. those who did not churn. This graph shows that customers who churned had higher average monthly charges than customers who did not churn. The fourth graph shows a bar chart of the average monthly charges for customers who churned vs. those who did not churn, broken down by gender. This graph shows that the churn rate is higher for males than for females, and that the average monthly charges are higher for males than for females. The fifth graph shows a bar chart of the average monthly charges for customers who churned vs. those who did not churn, broken down by age group. This graph shows that the churn rate is higher for younger customers than for older customers, and that the average monthly charges are higher for younger customers than for older customers. The sixth graph shows a bar chart of the average monthly charges for customers who churned vs. those who did not churn, broken down by contract type. This graph shows that the churn rate is higher for customers with month-to-month contracts than for customers with annual contracts, and that the average monthly charges are higher for customers with month-to-month contracts than for customers with annual contracts.
