It is difficult to see a clear pattern in this graph, although it does appear that there may be a positive correlation between the two variables. The second graph shows box plots of the churn rate vs monthly charges. This graph shows that the churn rate is higher for customers with higher monthly charges. The third graph shows a bar chart of the average monthly charges for customers who churned vs. those who did not churn. This graph shows that customers who churned had higher average monthly charges than customers who did not churn. The fourth graph shows a bar chart of the average monthly charges for customers who churned vs. those who did not churn, broken down by gender. This graph shows that the churn rate is higher for males than for females, and that the average monthly charges are higher for males than for females. The fifth graph shows a bar chart of the average monthly charges for customers who churned vs. those who did not churn, broken down by age group. This graph shows that the churn rate is higher for younger customers than for older customers, and that the average monthly charges are higher for younger customers than for older customers. The sixth graph shows a bar chart of the average monthly charges for customers who churned vs. those who did not churn, broken down by contract type. This graph shows that the churn rate is higher for customers with month-to-month contracts than for customers with annual contracts, and that the average monthly charges are higher for customers with month-to-month contracts than for customers with annual contracts. The seventh graph shows a bar chart of the average monthly charges for customers who churned vs. those who did not churn, broken down by payment method. This graph shows that the churn rate is higher for customers who pay by credit card than for customers who pay by other methods, and that the average monthly charges are higher for customers who pay by credit card than for customers who pay by other methods. The eighth graph shows a bar chart of the average monthly charges for customers who churned vs. those who did not churn, broken down by tech support calls. This graph shows that the churn rate is higher for customers who make more tech support calls, and that the average monthly charges are higher for customers who make more tech support calls. The ninth graph shows a bar chart of the average monthly charges for customers who churned vs. those who did not churn, broken down by streaming services. This graph shows that the churn rate is higher for customers who subscribe to more streaming services, and that the average monthly charges are higher for customers who subscribe to more streaming services. The tenth graph shows a bar chart of the average monthly charges for customers who churned vs. those who did not churn, broken down by device protection. This graph shows that the churn rate is higher for customers who have device protection, and that the average monthly charges are higher for customers who have device protection. The eleventh graph shows a bar chart of the average monthly charges for customers who churned vs. those who did not churn, broken down by online security. This graph shows that the churn rate is higher for customers who have online security, and that the average monthly charges are higher for customers who have online security. The twelfth graph shows a bar chart of the average monthly charges for customers who churned vs. those who did not churn, broken down by online backup. This graph shows that the churn rate is higher for customers who have online backup, and that the average monthly charges are higher for customers who have online backup. The thirteenth graph shows a bar chart of the average monthly charges for customers who churned vs. those who did not churn, broken down by total charges.
